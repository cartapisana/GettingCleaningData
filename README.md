# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Required "README.md" File

#### Submitted By:
Joseph W. Grubbs, Ph.D., AICP, GISP

#### Project Assignment:
Coursera Data Science Specialization  
Getting and Cleaning Data - Course 3  
Peer-Reviewed Project - Week 4

#### Project Purpose:
The peer-reviewed project (Getting and Cleaning Data, Week 4) tasked student-level data scientists to demonstrate their ability to collect, transform, and integrate multiple data sets. The goal of the project centered on creating "tidy" data, which may support future analysis. 

#### Submittal Requirements:
The submittal requirements for the project are as follows:
1. "Tidy" data set, as defined in the course material
2. Link to the student's Github repository, which must contain the source R script developed to perform the analysis ("run_analysis.R")
3. Code book documenting the source data sets, variables, variable definitions and specifications, and descriptions of the transformations and related tasks performed to produce the required project artifacts ("CodeBook.md") 
4. Documentation the GitHub repo with descriptive information for the "run_analysis.R" script, including how the script works, how the script components connect, functions implemented, rationale for each function, and other relevant information to support re-use of the R script ("README.md") -- THIS DOCUMENT

#### R Script Requirements:
Source R script developed for the project ("run_analysis.R") must perform the following:
1. Merge the multiple data sets for training and test into a single, integrated data set
2. Extract the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Assign descriptive variable labels to the study activities featured in the data set
4. Label the final data set with descriptive variable names
5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the mean of each variable by activity and subject

#### Peer-Review Criteria:
Peer reviewers will evaluate student submittals based on the following criteria:
1. The submitted data set is "tidy," as defined in the course material
2. The Github repo contains the required scripts ("run_analysis.R") and support documentation
3. The GitHub repo contains a code book ("CodeBook.md") that modifies and updates the source codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information
4. The GitHub repo contains a README.md file documenting the required information, cited above in the "Submittal Requirements" section
5. The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it

#### R Script Documentation:
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

#### Deadline Information:
It is especially important to submit this assignment before the deadline, March 26, 11:59 PM PDT, because it must be graded by others. If you submit late, there may not be enough classmates around to review your work. This makes it difficult - and in some cases, impossible - to produce a grade. Submit on time to avoid these risks.
